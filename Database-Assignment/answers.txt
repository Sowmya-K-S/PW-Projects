1. What is a Database? Explain with an example why we should need a database.
Ans: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that allows it to be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It typically uses tables to store related data, with each table consisting of rows (records) and columns (fields). Databases are designed to handle large amounts of information efficiently and securely.

Example:
Imagine you run an online store. Without a database, you'd have to store all your product information, customer details, and transaction records in separate files or documents. This would quickly become unwieldy and hard to manage as your business grows. Instead, using a database like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, you can:

Organize Data: Store product details (name, price, description) in a "Products" table, customer information (name, address, email) in a "Customers" table, and transaction records (order ID, product IDs, customer ID) in an "Orders" table.

Access Data Efficiently: Use queries to retrieve specific information quickly, such as finding all products in a certain price range, identifying customers who bought a particular item, or summarizing sales data by month.

Ensure Data Integrity: Apply constraints and rules to maintain data consistency and accuracy, such as ensuring each product has a unique ID or validating that orders are associated with existing customers.

Scale and Manage Growth: As your store expands, a database allows you to handle larger volumes of data without significant performance degradation, supporting your business operations effectively.


2. Write a short note on File base storage system. Explain the major challenges of a File-based storage system.
Ans: A file-based storage system organizes and manages data in the form of files within directories and subdirectories. Each file is stored with a unique name and can contain various types of data, such as documents, images, or application data.

Major Challenges of a File-Based Storage System:
-> Data Redundancy and Inconsistency
-> Difficulty in Data Access
-> Limited Security
-> Concurrency Issues:
-> Scalability Problems:
-> Lack of Data Relationships:
   

3. What is DBMS? What was the need for DBMS?
Ans: A Database Management System (DBMS) is software designed to create, manage, and manipulate databases. It provides an interface for users and applications to interact with the data stored within the database. DBMSs ensure data is organized, consistent, and easily accessible. Examples of popular DBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Need for DBMS:
-> Data Redundancy and Inconsistency
-> Data Integrity
-> Data Security
-> Data Access and Sharing
-> Data Independence
-> Efficient Data Management
-> Backup and Recovery
-> Data Relationships


4. Explain 5 challenges of file-based storage system which was tackled by DBMS.
Ans: 
Data Redundancy and Inconsistency:
   - File-Based System: Duplicate data across multiple files leads to waste and inconsistency.
   - DBMS: Centralizes data storage, reducing redundancy and maintaining consistency through normalization and integrity constraints.

Difficulty in Data Access:
   - File-Based System: Locating and accessing specific files becomes cumbersome as the number of files grows.
   - DBMS: Uses indexing and structured queries (SQL) to enable quick and efficient data retrieval.

Limited Security:
   - File-Based System: Lacks advanced security features, making it hard to control access to sensitive data.
   - DBMS: Provides robust security measures, including user authentication, access control, and data encryption.

Concurrency Issues:
   - File-Based System: Concurrent access by multiple users can lead to conflicts and data corruption.
   - DBMS: Manages concurrent access with transaction control mechanisms, ensuring data consistency and isolation.

Scalability Problems:
   - File-Based System: Becomes inefficient and slow when handling large volumes of data.
   - DBMS: Designed to efficiently manage large datasets, supporting scalability through optimized storage, indexing, and query performance.

7. Explain 3 schema architecture along with its advantages.
Ans: 

Three-Schema Architecture

The three-schema architecture is a framework for database systems that separates the database's conceptual design from its physical implementation. It consists of three levels of abstraction:

1. Internal Schema (Physical Schema):
   - Description: Describes how data is physically stored on the storage media. It involves the low-level data structures and storage details, such as file organization, indexing, and data retrieval mechanisms.
   - Advantages:
     - Performance Optimization: Allows for optimization of data storage and retrieval processes, improving system performance.
     - Physical Independence: Changes in physical storage do not affect the conceptual schema or application programs.

2. Conceptual Schema (Logical Schema):
   - Description: Represents the entire database's logical structure and organization without regard to how the data is physically stored. It includes entities, relationships, constraints, and rules defining the data and its relationships.
   - Advantages:
     - Data Abstraction: Provides a unified view of the entire database, simplifying the understanding of data and its relationships.
     - Consistency: Ensures data consistency and integrity by defining rules and constraints at the logical level.

3. External Schema (View Schema):
   - Description: Defines various views or subsets of the database tailored for different users or applications. It specifies what data users can access and how it should be presented.
   - Advantages:
     - User Customization: Allows different users to interact with the database in ways that are most relevant to their needs, without affecting the underlying database structure.
     - Security: Enhances data security by restricting access to specific portions of the database based on user roles and permissions.
